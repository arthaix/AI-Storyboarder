 AI Storyboarder

 📌 Project Overview
AI Storyboarder is a web-based application that transforms user-provided text prompts into structured visual storyboards using AI. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 for scene generation and DALL·E 3 for image creation, offering a streamlined tool for writers, game developers, and filmmakers to visualize their ideas quickly.

 🚀 Features
- AI-powered Scene Breakdown – Converts a short story idea into three structured scenes.
- Automated Image Generation – Uses DALL·E 3 to create visuals for each scene.
- User-Friendly UI – Simple and intuitive interface with dynamic updates.
- Downloadable Images – Users can save generated images with a single click.
- Style Customization – Choose from multiple AI art styles (Cinematic, Realism, Anime, Comic).

 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Fetch API)
- AI Models: OpenAI GPT-4 (text) + DALL·E 3 (images)

 🔧 Installation & Setup
 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (sign up at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/))
- Required dependencies

 Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/arthaix/AI-Storyboarder.git
   cd AI-Storyboarder
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install flask openai
   ```
3. Set your OpenAI API key:
   ```sh
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```
4. Run the Flask server:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open `index.html` in a browser and start generating AI-powered storyboards.

 📜 How It Works
1. User inputs a short story idea.
2. AI (GPT-4) processes the input and breaks it into three structured scenes.
3. AI (DALL·E 3) generates images for each scene.
4. The final storyboard is displayed with the option to download images.
